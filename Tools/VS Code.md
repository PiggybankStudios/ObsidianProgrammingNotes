## Notes
- [ ] I have v1.58.0 but updated to v1.100.2 on June 2nd 2025. I had to set the "Update" option to "Manual" in VS Code settings
- [ ] `.code-workspace` file can be created to allow changing of settings and configuration of a project beyond just using a particular folder as the project root
- [ ] Turning off Codelens removes the half-line information displays that I hate
- [ ] VS Code settings are saved at `%APPDATA%/Roaming/Code/User/settings.json` and `keybindings.json`
