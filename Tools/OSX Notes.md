## Notes
- [ ] In recent versions of Mac OS Sonoma, you can disable mouse acceleration from the advanced options of the mouse category in Settings
- [ ] [RedQuits](http://carsten-mielke.com/redquits.html) can be used to make the exit button actually close applications when you close the last window from that application
- [ ] Task Manager = Activity Monitor
- [ ] To allow an unverified app to run, after attempting to open go `Settings`->`Privacy&Security`->`Open Anyway`
- [ ] To "enable accessibility" or whatever find the application that needs access under `Security and Privacy` -> `Privacy` -> `Accessibility`. Unlock the settings in the bottom left and then enable the checkbox next to the application in question
- [ ] `install_name_tool` changes the install directory for a library or the directory of a dependency of an executable
- [ ] `otool -L [filename]` will list the install directory for a dll/exe
- [ ] `.a` is a static library, `.dylib` is a dll, and executables have no file extension
- [ ] To make a symlink to sublime I did `"ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/sublime`
- [ ] Frameworks are found in `/System/Library/Frameworks/`
- [ ] [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php) is used to install things from the command line. Command is `port`, i.e. `sudo port install clang-18`
- [ ] If you don't have XCode command line tools installed it will complain: `clang: warning: no such sysroot directory: '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX14.sdk' [-Wmissing-sysroot]`
- [ ] [Native Binaries on Apple Silicon](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/building-a-universal-macos-binary)
- [ ] `lipo` is a useful command for inspecting binaries (related to Mach-O universal binary object files) `lip -archs [binary]` to check that a binary has been compiled for both Intel and ARM chips
- [ ] `~/.zshrc` gets run whenever a zsh terminal instance is created (`~/.bashrc` for bash)
