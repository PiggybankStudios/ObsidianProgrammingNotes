	- [ ] Processing of the other `CMakeLists.txt` will happen immediately when this command is reached
- [ ] `add_executable(<name> <options>... <sources>...)` [Link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_executable.html#command:add_executable): Specify an executable to be built
	- [ ] Options: `WIN32`, `MACOSX_BUNDLE`, `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`
	- [ ] `<sources>` may use [Generator Syntax](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html#manual:cmake-generator-expressions(7)) like `$<...>` (Added in v3.1)
	- [ ] `<sources>` can be omitted if added later with [`target_sources()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_sources.html#command:target_sources)
	- [ ] `IMPORTED`: Reference an executable located outside the project (Optionally `GLOBAL`)
	- [ ] `<name> ALIAS <target>`: Allows you to refer to `<target>` by `<name>`
	- [ ] See `RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY` for changing where the executable is placed
	- [ ] See `OUTPUT_NAME` for changing the name of the executable
- [ ] `add_library(<name> [type] <sources>...)` [Link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_library.html#command:add_library): Specify a library to be built
	- [ ] `type` can be `STATIC`, `SHARED`, `MODULE`, `OBJECT`, `INTERFACE`

	- [ ] Optional `EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`
	- [ ] `IMPORTED`: Reference an executable located outside the project (Optionally `GLOBAL`)
	- [ ] `<name> ALIAS <target>`: Allows you to refer to `<target>` by `<name>`

- [ ] `configure_file(<input> <output>)` [Link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/configure_file.html#command:configure_file): Copy input file to output location and replace things like `@VAR@` in the file (usually a `.h.in` to a `.h`)
- [ ] `target_include_directories(<target> PUBLIC <items>...)` [Link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_include_directories.html#command:target_include_directories): Specifies the include directories to use when building a given target
- [ ] `target_link_libraries(<target>... <items>...)` [Link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_libraries.html#command:target_link_libraries): Specify libraries to use when linking a given target and/or it's dependents
	- [ ] Does **not** work on an `ALIAS` target!
	- [ ] Can also be used to define linker flags rather than libraries. Just pass the flag(s) for `<items>`
	- [ ] Prefix an item with `debug`, `optimized` or `general` to restrict it to only that build type
- [ ] `target_link_directories(<target> PUBLIC <items>...)` [Link](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_link_directories.html#command:target_link_directories): Adds directories to be searched when linking to the `<target>`
