## Notes
- [ ] `REM` and `::` can both be used as a pseudo comment syntax. However, `::` doesn't seem work properly when inside an `if ()`/`else ()` block
- [ ] `if "%VAR%"=="1" ( ... ) else ( ... )` <- if/else syntax. Note that `(` must be on same name as `if`/`else`
- [ ] `if not exist build mkdir build` <- Create a folder if it doesn't exist already
- [ ] `%time%` format `16:21:50.97`
- [ ] `set` [Link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/set_1) Sets an environment variable. Use `/a` to have the value numerically evaluated
